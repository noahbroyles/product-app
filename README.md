This project is a simple product tracking command-line application. I wrote it for fun in about 2 days and I think it's pretty cool.

With this program you can add, edit, buy, track and do all sorts of fun stuff with imaginary products. You can backup and import product listings, and all that good stuff. Enjoy!
If anyone actually ends using this for anything other than fun, please let me know! I would be thrilled!
